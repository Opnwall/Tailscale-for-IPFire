## Features

- Native IPFire Web UI integration
- Join Tailscale networks using authentication keys
- Supports custom hostnames, subnet routing, and exit node configuration
- Automatically detects platform architecture and downloads official Tailscale static binaries
- Supports English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese; defaults to English for other languages

## Tested Platforms

| Platform | Version |
|----------|----------|
| IPFire | 2.29 Core Update 202 |
| Architecture | x86_64 / amd64 |

## Installation

```bash
sh install.sh
```

## Uninstallation

```bash
sh uninstall.sh
```

## Configuration

After installation, open:

```text
Services > Tailscale
```

First, click Start and enter the authentication key, then configure the following items as needed:

- Hostname
- Accept Routes
- Advertised Routes
- Exit Node

Click "Save Settings," then click:

```text
Join Network
```

Once completed:
1. Open the Tailscale admin console.
2. Select the corresponding IPFire device.
3. Configure the settings to disable key expiry and enable advertised routes or exit node options.

## Tailscale Binaries

The installer downloads official static binaries from:

https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#static

## Notes

- Automatic deployment via the plugin settings page requires an authentication key.
- Route advertisements and exit nodes must be manually approved in the Tailscale admin console.
- DNS takeover is disabled by default (`--accept-dns=false`) to avoid overwriting the local IPFire DNS configuration.
